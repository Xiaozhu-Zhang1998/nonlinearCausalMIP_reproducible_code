## Guidelines for Reproducing the Experiments

### Graph structures
We provide the 10 graph structures used in our experiments in the folder `graphStructures`. For each structure, both the true graph edge set and the moral edge set are included.


Our implementation uses both R and Python. For each figure or table, please run the steps in order.
